     <b>
          HABITUSPHERE is an application that helps people reach their goals by changing bad habits into good ones.
          In todayâ€™s fast-paced and distracting world,
          many people struggle to stay focused on their goals.
          Instead of building healthy habits,
          they often fall into routines that waste time and lead them away from their dreams.
